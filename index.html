<h1>The Fox Browser</h1>
<img src="images/fox2.png" alt="Foxy logo">
<p>The fox browser is good because</p>
<ul>
    <li>it can access the internet</li>
    <li>it has a fox</li>
    <li>not sketchy</li>
</ul>
    <p>People like this browser mainly because it's completely open source and it doesn't have tracking etc. 
    It uses a bit more RAM than most browsers, but it has it's own task manager to help you see what uses it. Volunteers update it and they're doing a great job. Yay!</p>
